This is the demo source code of the proposed algorithm presented in:
"Abandoned Object Detection via Temporal Consistency Modeling and Back-Tracing Verification for Visual Surveillance," in IEEE Transaction on Information Forensic and Security (TIFS) 2015.
,and "Left-Luggage Detection from Finite-State-Machine Analysis in Static-Camera Videos," in International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2014.

Usage:
0. Run "ObjLeft.exe"
1. Select the input source (video filename/camera).
2. Double-chlick and set the Region-of-Interest. 
3. Double-press any key to start detection.


Note:
0. This code has been tested on Windows 7.
1. The human detector is NOT YET integrated with the tracking algorithm.
2. The C++ source codes will be available soon!
3. The parameter can be adjusted in "parameter.txt", we will provide a more friendly gui in future.
