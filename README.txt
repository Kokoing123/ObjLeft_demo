This is a C/C++ implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper:
"Abandoned Object Detection via Temporal Consistency Modeling and Back-Tracing Verification for Visual Surveillance," in IEEE TIFS 2015(to appear)
,and "Left-Luggage Detection from Finite-State-Machine Analysis in Static-Camera Videos," in ICPR2014

Note:
0. The demo code is beta version. 
1. The human detector is not integrated with the tracking algorithm yet. We will fix it soon!
2. This code has been tested on Windows 7.
3. The C++ source codes will be available soon!
4. The parameter can be adjusted in "parameter.txt", we will provide a more friendly gui in future.



Usage:
0. Run "ObjLeft.exe"
1. Select the input source (video filename/camera).
2. Double-chlick and set the Region-of-Interest. 
3. Double-press any key to start detection.
